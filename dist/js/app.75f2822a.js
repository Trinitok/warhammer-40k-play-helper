Unless the Chosen Battlefield mission rule is also in effect, before setting up this new objective marker, players must first move the objective marker in the centre of the battlefield 6” directly towards one of the corners of the battlefield (if No Man’s Land touches any corners of the battlefield, you must move the objective marker towards one of those corners). Players then set up the new objective marker 6” from the centre of the battlefield towards the diagonally opposite corner of the battlefield to the previously moved objective marker."},Minefields:{Special:"In this mission, each time an Advance roll of 6 is made for a unit, that unit suffers 1 mortal wound."},"Targets of Opportunity":{Special:"In this mission, if a player is using Tactical Missions, then each time that player determines which Secondary Mission cards are active for them, if they have fewer than 3 active Secondary Mission cards, that player draws from their Secondary Mission deck until they have 3 Secondary Mission cards. In this mission, if a player is using Fixed Missions, then in addition to the 2 Fixed Mission cards, that player will also draw cards from their Secondary Mission deck during the battle. At the end of the Select Secondary Missions step, that player should retrieve their Secondary Mission deck, remove all the Fixed Mission cards they did not select at the start of that step, then shuffle the remaining cards. Then, at the start of each of that player’s Command phases, if that player has fewer than 3 active Secondary Mission cards (including their Fixed Mission cards), they draw from their Secondary Mission deck until they have 3 Secondary Mission cards. That player has access to the New Orders Strategem, and can spend CP to use it after drawing their Secondary Mission cards if they wish (remember that Fixed Mission cards cannot be discarded for any reason)."},"Scrambler Fields":{Special:"In this mission: Players’ units with the Infiltrators ability cannot be set up within range of an objective marker that is either in No Man’s Land or their opponent’s deployment zone. Players’ units with the Scout ability that make a move before the first turn begins cannot end that move within range of an objective marker that is either in No Man’s Land or their opponent’s deployment zone. If any rule is used to redeploy a unit, that rule cannot be used to set up that unit within range of an objective marker in No Man’s Land. When a player’s Reserves and Strategic Reserves units are set up on the battlefield, they cannot be set up within range of an objective marker that is either in No Man’s Land or their opponent’s deployment zone."},"Delayed Reserves":{Special:"In this mission, until the start of the third battle round, each time a Reserves or Strategic Reserves unit wishes to arrive on the battlefield, the controlling player must make a Reserves roll for it. To do so, that player rolls one D6: on a 3+, that unit arrives on the battlefield; otherwise, the Reserves roll fails and that unit does not arrive this turn."},"Chosen Battlefield":{Special:"In this mission, objective markers are not placed as shown on the Deployment card drawn. Instead, players roll off at the start of the Place Objective Markers step, then alternate setting up objective markers, one at a time, starting with the winner of the roll off. One objective marker must be placed wholly within each deployment zone, and the remaining objective markers must be played wholly within No Man’s Land, as shown on the Deployment card drawn. Objective markers must be placed more than 6” away from any battlefield edge and more than 9” away from all other objective markers. If for whatever reason it is not possible to set up an objective marker as described above, it is not placed on the battlefield. If any rules require players to set up additional objective markers (e.g. Hidden Supplies) during the Place Objective Markers step, players set them up as described on this Mission Rule card. If any rules instruct players to remove one or more objective markers, do so after setting them all up."},"Maelstrom of Battle":{Special:"In this mission, shuffle the remaining Mission Rule cards together before drawing 2 new Mission Rule cards. If either of these new Mission Rule cards is Chilling rain, discard that Mission Rule card and draw 2 additional new Mission Rule cards (for a total of 3 new Mission Rule cards). Apply all the drawn Mission Rule cards to the battle."},"Supply Lines":{Special:"In this mission, if a player controls the objective marker in their own deployment zone at the start of their Command phase, they roll one D6: on a 4+, that player gains 1CP."},"Secret Intel":{Special:"In this mission, in each player’s Command phase, the first time that player draws Secondary Mission cards that phase, that player can draw one additional Secondary Mission card, and then discard one of their active Secondary Mission cards."},"Vox Static":{Special:"In this mission, the Command Re-roll Stratagem and New Orders Stratagem both cost 2CP to use."}},model:0}}};const lt=(0,r.Z)(st,[["render",ke]]);var ht=lt;function ct(e,t,o,a,i,r){const s=(0,n.up)("LeviathanRoundComponentVue"),l=(0,n.up)("v-expansion-panel-text"),h=(0,n.up)("v-expansion-panel"),c=(0,n.up)("v-expansion-panels");return(0,n.wg)(),(0,n.iD)(n.HY,null,[(0,n.Wm)(c,null,{default:(0,n.w5)((()=>[(0,n.Wm)(h,{title:"Player 1"},{default:(0,n.w5)((()=>[(0,n.Wm)(l,null,{default:(0,n.w5)((()=>[(0,n.Wm)(s)])),_:1})])),_:1})])),_:1}),(0,n.Wm)(c,null,{default:(0,n.w5)((()=>[(0,n.Wm)(h,{title:"Player 2"},{default:(0,n.w5)((()=>[(0,n.Wm)(l,null,{default:(0,n.w5)((()=>[(0,n.Wm)(s)])),_:1})])),_:1})])),_:1})],64)}function dt(e,t,o,a,i,r){const s=(0,n.up)("v-expansion-panel"),l=(0,n.up)("v-expansion-panels");return(0,n.wg)(),(0,n.j4)(l,null,{default:(0,n.w5)((()=>[(0,n.Wm)(s,{title:"Command Phase"},{default:(0,n.w5)((()=>[(0,n.Uk)(" Comand Phase ")])),_:1}),(0,n.Wm)(s,{title:"Movement"},{default:(0,n.w5)((()=>[(0,n.Uk)(" Movement ")])),_:1}),(0,n.Wm)(s,{title:"Shooting"},{default:(0,n.w5)((()=>[(0,n.Uk)(" Shooting ")])),_:1}),(0,n.Wm)(s,{title:"Charge"},{default:(0,n.w5)((()=>[(0,n.Uk)(" Charge ")])),_:1}),(0,n.Wm)(s,{title:"Fight"},{default:(0,n.w5)((()=>[(0,n.Uk)(" Fight ")])),_:1})])),_:1})}var ut={name:"LeviathanRoundComponent",setup(){}};const mt=(0,r.Z)(ut,[["render",dt]]);var pt=mt,ft={name:"LeviathanRoundView",components:{LeviathanRoundComponentVue:pt},setup(){}};const yt=(0,r.Z)(ft,[["render",ct]]);var wt=yt;const vt=(0,n._)("h1",null,"This is a skeleton template and will likely be replaced by something better...soon",-1),bt=(0,n._)("br",null,null,-1),gt=(0,n._)("br",null,null,-1);function kt(e,t,o,a,i,r){const s=(0,n.up)("v-alert-title"),l=(0,n.up)("v-alert"),h=(0,n.up)("v-btn");return(0,n.wg)(),(0,n.iD)(n.HY,null,[vt,bt,(0,n.Wm)(l,{density:"compact",type:"warning"},{default:(0,n.w5)((()=>[(0,n.Wm)(s,{class:"justify-center"},{default:(0,n.w5)((()=>[(0,n.Uk)(" No Backend Database!
