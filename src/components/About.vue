    <h1>Legal Disclaimer</h1>
    <p>
      All rights to Warhammer 40k are owned and maintained by Games Workshop.  This is a fan based project myself and some friends are doing in our spare time because we have too much free time and a lack of maturity and desire to escape the current social dystopia by playing with little overpriced plastic miniatures that exist in a science fiction dystopia in order to make our dystopian society less dystopian.
        <br />
Please support all WH40k related items and please join us in this fun (and at times infuriating) game by joining the community at the following website

    <h1>How Does This Work?</h1>
    <p>
        Simply hit the `play` button and this will walk you through the opening of a game in the current edition and rules of Warhammer 40k!
    </p>
    <h1>Why Make This?</h1>
    <p>
        This project is written because the game is already extremely complex and sometimes we need a little help clearing up rules.  There are a ton of rules in this game and they are constantly getting revised and updated.
        <br />
        In order to cut down on rules lawyering and the like, we have decided to make this app in order to help people out.
    </p>
    <h1>Rules Interpretation</h1>
    <p>
        All rules will be intrepreted as written in the official 40k rulebook

    </p>
    <h1>Updates</h1>
    <p>
        We will do our best to update, but make no guarantees on speed for updating.  We are only a couple folks and as much as we joke about it to the contrary, we do have lives outside of warhammer
    </p>
    <h1>Bugs</h1>
    <p>
        If you notice a bug or notice that there is something incorrect with the rules please create an issue or let one of the maintainers for the site know
