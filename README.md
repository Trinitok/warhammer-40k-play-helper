## Legal Disclaimer
All rights to Warhammer 40k are owned and maintained by Games Workshop.  This is a fan based project myself and some friends are doing in our spare time because we have too much free time and a lack of maturity and desire to escape the current social dystopia by playing with little overpriced plastic miniatures that exist in a science fiction dystopia in order to make our dystopian society less dystopian.

Please support all WH40k related items and please join us in this fun (and at times infuriating) game by joining the community at the following website

## General
This project is written because the game is already extremely complex and sometimes we need a little help clearing up rules.  There are a ton of rules in this game and they are constantly getting revised and updated.

In order to cut down on rules lawyering and the like, we have decided to make this app in order to help people out.

## Rules Interpretation
All rules will be intrepreted as written in the rulebook

## Updates
We will do our best to update, but make no guarantees on speed for updating.  We are only a couple folks and as much as we joke about it to the contrary, we do have lives outside of warhammer

## Bugs
If you notice a bug or notice that there is something incorrect with the rules please create an issue or let one of the maintainers for the site know
